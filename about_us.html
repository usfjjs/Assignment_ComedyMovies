                <li><strong>Experience developing this site:</strong> My only experience in web development was creating a single webpage for an undergraduate class in 2019. While working on ShareLaughs, I learned HTML from scratch. I found that completing several tutorials and searching for specific answers online helped me understand and develop the website effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Technologies used on this site:</strong> I used Visual Studio Code to develop the entire website. I created five HTML files, with one of them, the Join page, serving solely as a placeholder. The Reviews section functions as a mock implementation of CRUD operations. Additionally, I created one CSS file to manage and standardize the appearance of the webpage, along with one file to facilitate data visualization using Chart.js.</li>
